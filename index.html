               <p><a href="https://axiee-infinity.github.io/">Axie Infinity</a> is a non-fungible token-based online video game developed by Vietnamese studio Sky Mavis, known for its in-game economy which uses Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>Players of Axie Infinity collect and mint NFTs which represent axolotl-inspired digital pets known as Axies.[4] These creatures can be bred and battled with each other within the game. Sky Mavis charges a 4.25% fee to players when they trade Axies on its marketplace.</p>

<p>In September 2021, most Axie Infinity players were from the Philippines.They acted as low-wage workers for &quot;bosses&quot; who rented out Axies to them so they could grind in the game on the bosses&#39; behalf. This arrangement has been described as &quot;digital colonialism&quot;.</p>

<p>Axie Infinity is built on the Ronin Network, an Ethereum-linked sidechain developed by Sky Mavis. The game&#39;s official Cryptocurrency is &quot;Axie Infinity Shards/Token&quot; or AXS for short.[8] The game&#39;s secondary token, SLP, crashed in February 2022 amid a wider NFT and cryptocurrency crash, losing over 99% of its peak value.[9] In March 2022, hackers compromised the Ronin Network, stealing approximately US$620 million worth of cryptocurrency from the project The hackers were linked to Lazarus Group, funded by North Korea.</p>

<h2><a href="https://axiee-infinity.github.io/">Axie Infinity</a> Universe</h2>

<p>Axie Infinity is an online game universe revolving around Pok&eacute;mon-esque creatures known as Axies. Players can collect Axies as virtual pets with aspirations to battle, breed, collect, raise, and build kingdoms for their Axies. What makes Axie Infinity different from other online games is the synergy it has established between standard online gaming and&nbsp;blockchain. The&nbsp;Ethereum-based game utilizes a design that allows players to own their virtual assets and rewards players who are able to reach an advanced level of skill.6</p>

<p>To get started, users need to work through a multistep setup process to connect digital wallets and their Axie Infinity account, which is all detailed in the game&rsquo;s onboarding guide.7</p>

<p>Once the accounts are successfully connected, the player can interact with the digital marketplace. To play, users need three Axies. Once the player has three Axies, they can download the application and start playing. There is a lot of nuance around the cost of an Axie since the average price that is paid fluctuates based on factors such as rarity, experience, attributes, and type. As of this writing, the least expensive Axies, known as &ldquo;Floor Axies,&rdquo; cost around $30. Floor Axies are often weak in battle and likely won&rsquo;t be able to earn much for its owner. As of this writing, players can expect to pay a few hundred U.S. dollars for a usable team of Axies and upward of $1,000 for a rare Mystic Axie.8</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)</h2>

<p>Axie Infinity is recognized as the leader in&nbsp;non-fungible token (NFT)&nbsp;gaming. In-game digital assets such as the Axie creatures are represented by NFTs. These cryptographically unique tokens, as discussed, confer ownership and allow the player to trade Axies on the game&rsquo;s marketplace for real money.</p>

<p>In the realm of NFT projects, <a href="https://axiee-infinity.github.io/"><strong>Axie Infinity</strong></a> holds the record for the third-highest all-time sales. As of March 2022, Axie Infinity generated $4.17 billion in all-time NFT sales, below OpenSea&rsquo;s $23.21 billion and LooksRare&rsquo;s reported $18 billion.9</p>

<h2>Play-to-Earn Business Model (P2E)</h2>

<p>The play-to-earn (P2E) business model is new to the gaming industry. It is designed to reward participants who add value in certain ways to the game&rsquo;s world or ecosystem. The basis of P2E is predominantly based on the freemium model, which means that it is free to get started and then the user can pay to add new features, content, or gear or simply to progress more quickly through the game.</p>

<p>As of late February 2022, Axie Infinity does not follow the typical free-to-play model since players are required to start with three Axies, but according to decrypt.co, the company is reportedly planning on releasing free in-game starter monsters to appeal to new users who aren&rsquo;t ready to pay the premiums needed in the current model.10&nbsp;Granted, starter monsters likely will not be able to earn the player much in terms of reward tokens, but the shift could open the game to an even wider audience.</p>

<h2>Governance Tokens &mdash; <a href="https://axiee-infinity.github.io/">Axie Infinity</a> Shards ($AXS)</h2>

<p>One of the most significant Ethereum tokens is known as ERC-20, which emerged as a technical standard used for all smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. While the details go beyond the scope of this article, it is relevant here because Axie Infinity Shards (AXS) are an&nbsp;ERC-20&nbsp;governance token for the Axie Universe. It can be thought of as the native currency to the game, and holders can claim rewards if they stake their tokens, play the game, and participate in key governance votes.11</p>

<p>As of Feb. 27, 2022, AXS has increased by more than 3,000% relative to the U.S. dollar over the past year.12</p>

<p>The AXS tokens are an intentional move by Sky Mavis to decentralize the ownership and governance of Axie infinity so that it aligns the interests between the developers and the community of players who actually play the game.11</p>

<h2>Reward Tokens &mdash; Smooth Love Potion (SLP)</h2>

<p>A Smooth Love Potion (SLP), formerly known as a small love potion, is a reward token within Axie Infinity that can be earned by players in certain ways by playing the game in battle or adventure mode. SLP is an ERC-20 utility token that carries a value like other cryptocurrencies and can be bought and sold on a decentralized exchange.</p>

<p>The value of an SLP relative to the U.S. dollar hasn&rsquo;t performed so well compared to AXS and is down sharply over the past year. Unlike AXS, which has a supply cap of 270 million tokens, SLP has an uncapped number of tokens that could exist in the future.1314</p>

<p>The uncertainty around the future supply of SLP has greatly impacted its value, and concerns around its stability have caused many to question what will happen in the future. Sky Mavis has made some adjustments to the emission rate in recent months, and potential changes based on governance votes in the future likely will continue to drastically impact the value of SLP.</p>
